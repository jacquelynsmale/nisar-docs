# NISAR User Guide

The joint NASA/ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) platform provides a better understanding of changes in Earth’s ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, groundwater, and natural hazards.

NISAR's dual-band radar systematically maps Earth day and night and in any weather, measuring changes of our planet's surface as small as a centimeter.

All NISAR science data is freely available and open to the public, consistent with the long-standing NASA Earth Science open data policy.
